Task 2

Question 1: What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?

As the number of hidden nodes increases, the model’s capacity to learn complex patterns increases. With more nodes, the network can represent more intricate decision boundaries, potentially improving accuracy on non-linearly separable data .
However, too many nodes (e.g., 50) may lead to overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data but performs poorly on unseen data. You may observe high accuracy for larger n_h, but check if the decision boundary becomes overly complex or jagged.


Question 2: Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

For small n_h , the model may underfit, resulting in lower accuracy because it lacks the capacity to capture the data’s complexity.
For medium n_h , accuracy typically increases as the model better fits the data.
For large n_h, accuracy may plateau or slightly decrease if overfitting occurs, especially if the dataset is small or noisy. The pattern depends on the dataset’s complexity and the number of iterations.
